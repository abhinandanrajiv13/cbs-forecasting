# The Case

## Case Company
- "Santander Cycles" (government-run)
- Sponsored by Santander, Private Banking, [37th largest corporation world-wide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Santander)
- Record: 73.000 bike rentals in a day

```{r, out.width = "700px"}
knitr::include_graphics("day2_santander.jpg")
```

## The Problem
- __Staffing the correct number of bikes__
- Minimise outdoor time to
    - reduce operating costs (electricity)
    - decrease weather teardown and exposure to vandalism
    - undertake maintenance
- Maximise availability as not never under-staff
    - valuability of the service is heavily dependent on availability
    - non-availability is causing churn
    - non-availability is decreasing profits


## The Value
- Correctly forecasting demand, especially spikes
    - retains customers
    - maximises profit
    - minimises costs
    
## The Data
Dataset: `data/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.csv` [(Source)](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/number-bicycle-hires)

```{r, echo=T}
data = read.csv('data/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.csv')
plot(data)
lines(data)
```

## Tasks
- Load and plot data
- Inspect data: decide whether or not to make stationary or not (via `log()`)
- Prepare dataframe for `prophet` (Rename its columns to `ds`, `y`)
- Create dataframe for `holidays` from
    - `UK_holidays.csv` and
    - `UK_tube-strikes.csv`
- Predict next 365 days
    - plot prediction
    - plot components
    
## Tasks
- Interpret prediction - describe
    - patterns (yearly/weekly seasonality)
    - effect of bank holidays/tube strikes
    - trend
    - peaks/bottoms
- Cross-validate prediction
- Describe business implications of your forecast
