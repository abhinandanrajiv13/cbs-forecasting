```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## Welcome back
Remember... we predict the future based on the past
```{r include=FALSE}
source("data/prophetpred.R")
```
```{r, warning = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
plot(m, forecast)
```

## Including External Data
- <span style="color:red">**We predict the future based on the past**</span>
- Some movements cannot explained by the past (these are the *residuals*)
- Many things cannot be explained by merely looking at the series
- No season, no trend, no level, no systematic movements

```{r, out.width = "400px"}
knitr::include_graphics("../day1/images/day1_vwstock.png")
```

## Influential, External Activity
- Gasoline prices (car sales)
- Weather (icecream consumption)
- Competitor activity
    - ad spend
    - pricing
    - promotions
- Product launches (iPhone launch)
- Black Friday
- Bank Holidays

# Problem: Knowing Future Values


## For which influence factor do you Know its **FUTURE** value?
- Gasoline prices (car sales)
- Weather (icecream consumption)
- Competitor activity
    - ad spend
    - pricing
    - promotions
- Product launches (iPhone launch)
- Black Friday
- Bank Holidays
- Football playoffs


## Some Events are Known Beforehand
- Product launches (iPhone launch)
- Black Friday
- Bank Holidays
- Football playoffs


# Case Study: Wikipedia Load Balancing


## An Example: Load Balancing
Peyton Manning, NFL Quarterback

```{r, out.width = "400px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/day2_peytonwiki.jpg")
```

<https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Manning>


## Plot Data
```{r, warning = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
df <- read.csv('data/example_wp_peyton_manning.csv')
plot(df)
lines(df)
```

## Stationarity
The mean of the series should not be a function of time rather should be a constant

```{r, out.width = "350px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/day2_stationarity_1.png")
```

The variance of the series should not a be a function of time

```{r, out.width = "350px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/day2_stationarity_2.png")
```

## Stationarity

The covariance of the i th term and the (i + m) th term should not be a function of time. In the following graph, you will notice the spread becomes closer as the time increases. Hence, the covariance is not constant with time for the ‘red series’.

```{r, out.width = "350px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/day2_stationarity_3.png")
```


## Make Data Stationary
```{r, warning = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# load data
df = read.csv('data/example_wp_peyton_manning.csv')
head(df, n=5)
```

## Make Data Stationary
```{r, warning = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# log-transform data
df['y'] = log(df['y'])
plot(df)
```


## Forecast
```{r, warning = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library(prophet)
# load data
df = read.csv('data/example_wp_peyton_manning.csv')
head(df, n=5)
# log-transform data
df['y'] = log(df['y'])
m = prophet(df)
future = make_future_dataframe(m, periods = 365)
forecast = predict(m, future)
```

## Plot Forecast
```{r, warning = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
plot(m, forecast)
```


# Notice the Spikes

## Including External Events
```{r, warning = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
playoffs <- data_frame(
  holiday = 'playoff',
  ds = as.Date(c('2008-01-13', '2009-01-03', '2010-01-16',
                 '2010-01-24', '2010-02-07', '2011-01-08',
                 '2013-01-12', '2014-01-12', '2014-01-19',
                 '2014-02-02', '2015-01-11', '2016-01-17',
                 '2016-01-24', '2016-02-07')),
  lower_window = 0,
  upper_window = 1
)
superbowls <- data_frame(
  holiday = 'superbowl',
  ds = as.Date(c('2010-02-07', '2014-02-02', '2016-02-07')),
  lower_window = 0,
  upper_window = 1
)
holidays <- bind_rows(playoffs, superbowls)
```

## Predict with External Events (The Code)
```{r, warning = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
df <- read.csv('data/example_wp_peyton_manning.csv')
# log-transform data
df['y'] = log(df['y'])
# include holidays
m_hol <- prophet(df, holidays = holidays)
```


## Predict with External Events (The Code)
```{r, warning = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# predict
future_hol <- make_future_dataframe(m_hol, periods = 365)
forecast_hol <- predict(m_hol, future_hol)
```

## Including External Events
```{r, warning = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
plot(m_hol, forecast_hol)
```


## Including External Events
```{r, warning = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
prophet_plot_components(m_hol, forecast_hol)
```


## Compare
```{r, warning = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
plot(m_hol, forecast_hol)
```


## Compare
```{r, warning = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
plot(m, forecast)
```


# Recap

## Recap
- Including future values can improve the forecasting accuracy tremendously
- Especially, it can help explain sudden **spikes**
- The Problem: knowing its future value
- Calendar events are well-suited
